Abstract


   This manual contains a description of the Oslo CTM3
   and how to set up simulations. Information about emissions,
   which type of simulation you want do, with which
   components etc. are described, but most of all, this manual
   attempts to document the different processes and the
   source code of the Oslo CTM3.
